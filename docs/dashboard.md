# Dashboard design

Follow Azure Portal shell and resource interactions using Fluent UI v9. Use an Azure blue accent with semantic tokens, light/dark themes, Segoe UI/system font fallback, and concise English/Indonesian copy.

The persistent header owns permitted-resource search, company switcher, notifications, theme, and account. A collapsible sidebar groups modules. The workspace has breadcrumb, title/status, command bar, and content. Lists have server filters/sort/pagination, optional bulk actions, and resource links. Quick inspection uses a side panel; employee profiles and payroll runs use routed detail pages with tabs. Setup/import/payroll use staged workflows.

Shared components: AppPortalShell, AppPageHeader, AppCommandBar, AppFilterBar, AppDataTable, AppDetailsPanel, AppStatusBadge, and form controls. All support keyboard navigation, focus restoration, semantic status, and responsive layouts. Tables default to 50 rows; only genuinely long client lists need virtualization.

Pages consume display state and dispatch actions. Query/cache ownership includes account and company. Company switching cancels outstanding queries and removes obsolete view data. Filters live in the URL. Dirty forms require an explicit navigation decision. Polling/listeners stop when inactive.

Primary screens: organization and employee directory; roster and attendance exceptions; leave requests/balances; approval inbox; expense claims/payments; payroll periods/runs/reconciliation; documents; announcements; reports; settings/audit/jobs.
